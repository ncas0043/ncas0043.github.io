        <h2>The importance of branding</h2>
        

        <p class="quote"> Branding is important because not only is it what makes a memorable impression on consumers but it allows your customers and clients to
            know what to expect from your company. It is a way of distinguishing yourself from the competitors and 
            clarifying what it is you offer that makes you the better choice. Your brand is built to be a true representation 
            of who you are as a business, and how you wish to be perceived.There are many areas that are used to develop a brand including advertising, customer service, social responsibility,
            reputation, and visuals. All of these elements (and many more) work together to create
            one unique and (hopefully) attention-grabbing profile.</p>

        <h2>What is branding?</h2>
        <p class="quote2">Branding is the perpetual process of identifying, creating, and managing the cumulative assets and actions
             that shape the perception of a brand in stakeholdersâ€™ minds. There is a structured process to branding, one where you must first identify who/what you want to be to your stakeholders, create your brand strategy to position yourself accordingly, 
             and then constantly manage everything that influences your positioning.
